# :mountain: Depth-aware Convolution for PyTorch
An implementation depth-aware convolution in PyTorch from: [Depth-aware CNN for RGB-D Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06791.pdf).
The convolution is entirely implemented with PyTorch components, it was not written as a C extension, so it's not the fastest.
